This application was created to parse text from websites for Hapticomm Project by Rasul Yermagambet

Download the version depending on your OS

To use the programm just run parser.exe, paste your url and press 'Parse' button. You can open your txt file by pressing 'Open File' button.
The text files are stored in folder 'Parsed_Files'.

If you don't want to download exe file, you can download scripts and run them from anaconda environment. Create anaconda environment by using: 
	conda create --name <name_of_env> --file package-list.txt

Future release with better UI/UX will be available soon.
